### [🚦 Throttler Scalability Analysis](./throttler-scalability-analysis.md)
**Status:** 🔴 Critical  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-08  
**Summary:** Analysis of current throttling limitations and Redis-based solutions for 5M+ req/min

Critical findings:
- Current Map-based implementation fails at scale
- O(n) cleanup operations block event loop
- Memory usage grows unbounded
- Cannot handle >10,000 concurrent users

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediate: Implement Redis-based throttling
2. Short-term: Add Nginx rate limiting
3. Long-term: CDN/API Gateway solution

## 🎯 Performance Targets

| Component | Current | Target | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Throttler | 1K req/s | 83K req/s | ❌ Critical |
| Database | TBD | TBD | 🔄 Pending |
| Memory Usage | TBD | TBD | 🔄 Pending |
| Response Time | TBD | TBD | 🔄 Pending |

## 📋 Optimization Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] Redis throttling implementation
- [ ] Memory leak prevention audit
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimization

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Static asset optimization
- [ ] API response compression

### Low Priority
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] CDN integration
- [ ] Geographic distribution

## 🔧 Testing & Monitoring

### Load Testing Commands
```bash
# Throttler stress test
ab -n 1000000 -c 1000 http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Memory profiling
node --expose-gc --inspect app.js
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Request throughput (req/s)
- Memory usage (MB)
- Response latency (ms)
- Error rates (%)
- Cache hit ratios (%)
